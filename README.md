# Basic Calculator

This is simply an application of the knowledge gotten over studies in Array, Array methods, Objects, Regex, CSS Grid etc.

The project _Basic Calculator_ is so far my **toughest task** using Javascript.

The operations of the Calculator were built with its specific function from start. The eval() function and new Function() methods were not used because they pose [possible threats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_eval!).

This project is a work in progress and I will revisit and re-work it to add more features in nearest future.
